Android Lab 4 - Score Keeper

This app is a tool for tracking the score between two different basketball teams. For the layout, I have used a parent constraint layout as what has been suggested in the android documentation guidelines. I used different types of UI components in this app such as TextView, EditText, Buttons, Toggle and Radio Button Group. 

By default, the score will start at zero for both teams. To add/deduct a score in either teams, the user should click on the Toggle button to select which team should apply to. Also, the user needs to select the correct amount of points from the radio button group options. An extra button was created to reset the score back to zero.


Below is the sample preview of how the app looks like:
