# JAV1001-ScoreKeeper

### Project Description
This app is a tool for tracking the score between two different basketball teams. For the layout, I have used a parent constraint layout as what has been suggested in the android documentation guidelines. I used different types of UI components in this app such as TextView, EditText, Buttons, Toggle and Radio Button Group. 

By default, the score will start at zero for both teams. To add/deduct a score in either teams, the user should click on the Toggle button to select which team should apply to. Also, the user needs to select the correct amount of points from the radio button group options. An extra button was created to reset the score back to zero.

A negative score is not allowed and a corresponding error message will be prompted from the screen.

### Prerequisites

Android Studio installation is required to test this application.

### Installing

To get a copy of the code, you may clone this repository or download the zip folder and open from Android Studio. 

### Running the tests

Prior to running the app, make sure the following is properly setup:

1. There is a simulator device installed via AVD manager.
2. The installed gradle build and JDK version matches the one used when creating the app. Android Studio provide some suggestions to synchronize these settings.

Once all the above conditions are satisfied, just click the 'Run' icon in Android Studio to test the application.
